# Text-editor

Build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

Start with an existing application and implement methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. Use a package called idb (a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API).
